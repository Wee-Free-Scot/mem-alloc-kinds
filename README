How to edit and build the Memory Allocation Kinds side document
===============================================================

This directory is cloned from the MPIR Process Acquisition
Interface side document.

To build a PDF of this document, use the makefile in
this directory. This will create a file called 
mpi-report.pdf (in the format of the MPI standard).

To add text for this chapter, edit one of the files
in the subdirectory chap-prof. This directory contains
a README file listing all files. Additional macro
definitions or changes should be done in mpi-macs.tex
in this directory.
