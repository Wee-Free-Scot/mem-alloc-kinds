How to edit and build the tools chapter document
================================================

This directory is cloned from the MPI 2.2 standard with
most chapters removed, except for the profiling chapter,
which gets replaced with a chapter on tools interfaces
in general.

To build a PDF of this document, use the makefile in
this directory. This will create a file called 
mpi-report.pdf (in the format of the MPI standard).

To add text for this chapter, edit one of the files
in the subdirectory chap-prof. This directory contains
a README file listing all files. Additional macro
definitions or changes should be done in mpi-macs.tex
in this directory.
