%This document is the product of a number of
%  distinct efforts in four distinct phases: one for each of \MPII/,
%  \MPIII/, \MPIIII/, and \MPIIV/.  This section describes these in historical
%  order, starting with \MPII/.  Some efforts, particularly parts of
%  \MPIII/, had distinct groups of individuals associated with them,
%  and these efforts are detailed separately.

This document represents the work of many people who have served on
the \MPIHACC/.  The meetings have been attended by dozens of people
from many parts of the world. It is the hard and dedicated work of
this group that has led to the \MEMALLOCDOC/ document. The technical
development was carried out by subgroups, whose work was reviewed by
the full committee.

Those who served as primary coordinators in Version 1.0 are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Rohit Zambre, James Dinan, Nvidia CUDA
\item Edgar Gabriel, Pedram Alizadeh, Michael Klemm, AMD ROCm
\item Maria Garzaran, Daniel Holmes, Intel Level Zero
